      <h3 name="what-is">What is Bitcoin?</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin is a new type of currency, similar to USD (United States Dollar)
      or GBP (British Pound), except with some key differences. In addition
      to Bitcoin there are many other new currencies that are very similar to
      Bitcoin, such as Litecoin or Dogecoin. These are freqently referred to
      collectively as Altcoins, and are all forms of <i>Cryptocurrency</i>.</p>
      <b>Key differences between Bitcoin and Fiat currency</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Completely digital.</b> The money has no physical form like dollars or coins.</li>
        <li><b>Decentralized.</b> No one party controls the creation and regulation of the coins. Instead it is performed as a shared task between thousands thorugh a process known as <i>mining</i>.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3 name="why-use">Why would I use Bitoin instead of regular currency?</h3>
      <b>Transactions are irreversible</b>
      <p>Just like a bank wire, moving Bitcoins is unrefundable. Since regular
      credit (or debit) card transactions can be reversed this exposes
      merchants to a certain amount of risk when accepting that form of
      payment. In addition to the risk, handling the entire process of a
      reversal is somewhat complicated, and incurs overhead. These costs increase
      the price of goods and can make certain types of businesses unworkable.</p>
      <b>Low fees</b>
      <p>While this may not always be true (for reasons that are beyond this
      post to explain), compared to something like a credit card transaction
      Bitcoin transactions are cheap. You could send $1,000,000 USD with a 
      transaction fee of about $0.10.</p>
      <b>Comparatively Fast</b>
      <p>While a complete transfer of Bitcoin takes about 1 hour, making it
      slower than using a credit card, it is still much faster than a bank wire
      or ACH transfer. For businesses that cannot use credit card transactions
      this speed is valuable.</p>

      <br>
      <h3 name="control">Who controls Bitcoin?</h3>
      <p>No one central authority controls Bitcoin, and this is part of what
      makes it different then other currencies. Traditional currencies like the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">United States Dollar (USD)</a>
      are controlled by the government. In the case of the
    United States minting and circulation of new currency is controlled by the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System">Federal Reserve</a>.</p>

      <p>By contrast, creation of new Bitcoins and regulation of how they are
      spent is controlled by many people through a process known as <a href="TODO">mining</a>.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h3 name="block">What is a block?</h3>
      <p>A block is a grouping of transactions. Blocks are added to the network
      through "mining," which serves two purposes: minting of new funds in the
      network, and confirming transactions. The "block reward" is an arbitrary amount
      of funds that the block finder is awarded for their work, and is what seeds the
      funds in the network. In addition to transaction information every block contains
      a link that points to the block that was discovered before it. These links could
      be followed back all the way until reaching the "genesis block," which is a special
      block that started the network.</p>

      <br>
      <h3 name="altcoins">What are altcoins?</h3>
      <p>When Bitcoin was created in 2009 it was the first of it's kind. The 
      first currency that was completely digital. Over time as it became popular
      and trusted, people took the same software that runs the Bitcoin network
      and created their own similar, but slightly different networks. These 
      different coins are often referred to as Altcoins as they're alternatives
      to Bicoin. There are hundreds of altcoins. Some are completely worthless
      clones, and some have valuable differences. Most (if not all) of the
      information on this website that refers to Bicoin also applies to
      Altcoins.</p>
