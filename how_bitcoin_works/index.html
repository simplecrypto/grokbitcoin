      <p>As discuessed in in "What is mining?", mining Bitcoins, or any other 
      Altcoin is difficult, and can take a long time. In addition, whether you
      find anything while mining is random, so sometimes your unlucky and it 
      takes a long time, while other times you're lucky and it takes less time.
      This is referred to as variance. 
      <h3 name="how-long">How long does it take to solve a block?</h3>
      <p>This is not a straightforward question to answer. Mining can be thought of
      like rolling dice. Imagine a regular six sided dice. Say we want to know how
      many rolls it will take to roll a 1. Well probability would say our chances are
      1/6, so after 6 rolls we'll have rolled a 1, right? But maybe we'll be lucky
      and get it on the first roll... It's random. Probabilities like this can be
      shown by a "standard distribution", as shown below, with the "average" case
      being at the center. So what do the numbers mean?  Imagine you do an experiment
      where you roll a dice until you get a 1. You record the number of rolls that it
      took. Now repeat this 10,000 times. Now graph the results. Your graph will look
      just like the standard distribution below, with the most common trial taking 6
      rolls and being at the center, and it becomming increasingly less common to in
      either direction.
      <br><br>
      Alright, enough of this. Back to cryptocurrency. So trying to find a block is
      just like rolling those dice. It's random. Think of finding the block as
      rolling a dice with millions of millions of sides, and your computer is
      rolling it thousands of times per second. Lets say you find the block if you
      roll a 1. We can now say on average how much time it will take to roll the one
      by dividing the number of sides on the dice by the number of rolls per second
      that your computer can do. This is exactly how round estimates are calculated,
      and that's why sometimes it takes longer than expected to find a block and
      other times its found early.
      </p>

      <h3 name="diff">What is the difficulty, or target?</h3>
      <p>When mining for coins the goal is to find a hash that meets the target. Say
      you're mining, and you just got a new hash and want to see if it's good enough.
      Well the hash is just a number. Just a bunch of bits, 0s and 1s. The target is
      also a number. The rules say to be valid your hash has to be smaller than the
      target. Difficulty is just the inverse of the target, so the more difficult the
      lower the target. So what's the point? Well the idea is that by making the
      target larger or smaller you make finding a valid hash more or less difficult.
      Using the dice analogy, if your goal (or target..) is to roll a 3 or lower then
      that's less difficult (will take fewer rolls on average) than needing to roll a
      2 or lower.  Why is this important? Well one of the goals of cryptocurrencies
      is to mint new money at a constant rate. But if more people start mining, won't
      blocks be found at a more rapid rate? To balance this out a process called
      retargeting which adjusts how difficult it _should_ be to find subsequent
      blocks.

      <h3 name="what-is">What is retargeting?</h3>
      <p>In general it is desirable to find new blocks at a constant rate. To achieve
      this, the target (or inversely difficuly) gets adjusted by retargeting. Early
      retargeting algorithms were very basic. Essentially after some number of blocks
      has been solved they look at the last x number of solved blocks and see how
      long it took to find them on average. Depending on how much faster or slower
      the average was than some target speed (which varies by crypto. 1 minute for
      Doge) then the difficulty will increase or deacrease. Modern retargeting
      algorithms are a bit more complicated and try to factor in problem that arise
      when massive numbers of people join or leave the network rapidly, among other
      technical challenges.</p>

      <h3>What is a share?</h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3 name="why-join">Why should I join a pool?</h3>
      <p>With most major cryptocurrencies finding a block is very difficult. So
      difficult that most average computer setups would take weeks if not years to
      find the next block working by themselves. Why is this bad in itself? Mostly a
      factor of variance, a result of the randomness of finding a block. If on
      average you are supposed to find a block every 2 weeks that means it could take
      4 weeks in reality, reducing your profits by 100% because being unlucky. With a
      pool people work together and find blocks at a more rapid pace, and over the
      same time period you might solve several blocks, some unlucky and some lucky.

      <h3 name="hash">What is a hash?</h3>
      <p>A hash is the output of function that takes some input, and produces a
      different output. This ourput is usually of a fixed length (like say, 2
      characters), but not always. There are tons of types of hash functions, but
      cryptocurrencies are usually only concerned with what are called
      "cryptographically secure hash functions." These are functions that are very
      very very difficult to run in reverse, ie we can't figure out what the input
      was by looking at the output. This is important as you can see in the "What is
      the difficulty, or target?"</p>
